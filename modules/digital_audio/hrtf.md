## 3D Sound in Tone.js

### [Tone.Panner3D](http://tonejs.github.io/docs/Panner3D)

All audio you pass through this node will be spatialized. Does not necessarily need to be connected directly to the master output, but can be run through additional effects. 

### [Tone.Listener](http://tonejs.github.io/docs/Listener)

There is only one listener. It models the listeners head and allows you to interact with the positioned audio.
