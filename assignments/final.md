Create a piece of music. Consider the affects of space and sound localization in your assignments. 

Your piece (or your presentation) should be no more than 5 minutes long. 

## Optional Constraint

Create your piece entirely with these samples:
*  [Berklee's One Laptop Per Child Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kTp37pkBnbcBwqvE8KsVNFF1F6cDM9me/view?usp=sharing) 
	* Creative Commons 
* [Ambisonic Recordings]()

## Optional Score

Represent your music graphically as a score. Create your own notation if you choose. This is especially useful to organize your thoughts for composition, but also for documenting your piece and potentially reproducing your piece. This is also useful if your piece can't be rendered binaurally.
